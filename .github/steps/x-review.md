## Review

_Congratulations! You've successfully modernized Merginton High School's legacy accounting system and brought it into the modern era!_

Here's a recap of your impressive accomplishments:

- Explain the current COBOL accounting system
- Create a mermaid dataflow diagram for the legacy COBOL accounting system
- Create a TESTPLAN for the legacy COBOL accounting system
- Convert the legacy COBOL code to a modern Node.js application
- Write unit tests for the Node.js application based on the original COBOL test cases
- Run the application tests and verify the Node.js application

The school's administration is thrilled with the results! The new system is not only easier to maintain but provides better service to students, parents, and staff. The IT team can now quickly implement new features as school needs evolve, and the integration with other school systems has dramatically reduced administrative workload.
